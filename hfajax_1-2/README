We need to create the thumbnails.js file, and add a JavaScript
function to set up the initial event handlers for each thumbnail image in
the inventory. Let’s call that function initPage(), and set it to run
as soon as the user’s window loads the inventory page.

To set up the onclick behavior for the thumbnails,
the initPage() function has to do two things:

1. Find the thumbnails on the page
The thumbnails are contained in a div called “thumbnailPane,” so we can find that
div, and then find each image within it.

2. Build the onclick event handler for each thumbnail
Each item’s full-size image is named with the title of the thumbnail image
plus “-detail”. For example, the detail image for the thumbnail with the title
FenderGuitar is FenderGuitar-detail.png. That lets us work out the
name of the image in our JavaScript.
The event handler for each thumbnail should set the src tag for the detail image (the
one with an id of “itemDetail”) to the detail image (for example, FenderGuitar-
detail.png). Once you’ve done that, the browser will automatically display the
new image using the name you supplied.
