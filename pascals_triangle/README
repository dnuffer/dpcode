The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle.

    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
   ...
The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a function that computes the elements of Pascal's triangle by means of a recursive process.

Do this exercise by implementing the pascal function, which takes a column c and a row r, counting from 0 and returns the number at that spot in the triangle. For example, pascal(0,2)=1, pascal(1,2)=2 and pascal(1,3)=3.
