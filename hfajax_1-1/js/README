Modify the XHTML web page
We need to include the JavaScript file weâ€™re going to write and
add some divs and ids, so our JavaScript can find and work
with different parts of the web page.
- add a reference to thumbnails.js
- create divs for the thumbnail pane "thumbnailPane", and "description" in the details pane
