function genotypeFactor = genotypeGivenAlleleFreqsFactor(alleleFreqs, genotypeVar)
% This function computes the probability of each genotype given the allele 
% frequencies in the population.

% Note that we assume that the copies of the gene are independent.  Thus,
% knowing the allele for one copy of the gene does not affect the
% probability of having each allele for the other copy of the gene.  As a
% result, the probability of a genotype is the product of the frequencies 
% of its constituent alleles (or twice that product for heterozygous 
% genotypes).

% Input:
%   alleleFreqs: An n x 1 vector of the frequencies of the alleles in the 
%   population, where n is the number of alleles
%   genotypeVar: The variable number for the genotype (goes in the .var
%   part of the factor)
%
% Output:
%   genotypeFactor: Factor in which the val has the probability of having 
%   each genotype (note that this is the FULL CPD with no evidence 
%   observed)

% The number of genotypes is (number of alleles choose 2) + number of 
% alleles -- need to add number of alleles at the end to account for 
% homozygotes

genotypeFactor = struct('var', [], 'card', [], 'val', []);
numAlleles = length(alleleFreqs);

% Each allele has an ID that is the index of its allele frequency in the 
% allele frequency list.  Each genotype also has an ID.  We need allele and
% genotype IDs so that we know what genotype and alleles correspond to each
% probability in the .val part of the factor.  For example, the first entry
% in .val corresponds to the probability of having the genotype with
% genotype ID 1, which consists of having two copies of the allele with
% allele ID 1.  There is a mapping from a pair of allele IDs to genotype 
% IDs and from genotype IDs to a pair of allele IDs below; we compute this 
% mapping using generateAlleleGenotypeMappers(numAlleles). (A genotype 
% consists of 2 alleles.)

[allelesToGenotypes, genotypesToAlleles] = generateAlleleGenotypeMappers(numAlleles);

% One or both of these matrices might be useful.
%
%   1.  allelesToGenotypes: n x n matrix that maps pairs of allele IDs to 
%   genotype IDs, where n is the number of alleles -- if 
%   allelesToGenotypes(i, j) = k, then the genotype with ID k comprises of 
%   the alleles with IDs i and j
%
%   2.  genotypesToAlleles: m x 2 matrix of allele IDs, where m is the 
%   number of genotypes -- if genotypesToAlleles(k, :) = [i, j], then the 
%   genotype with ID k is comprised of the allele with ID i and the allele 
%   with ID j
