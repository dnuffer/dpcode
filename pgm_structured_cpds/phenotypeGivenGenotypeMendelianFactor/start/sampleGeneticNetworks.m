% This script contains the solutions for the code for some simple examples.
% There is also a call to each of the functions that you should create that
% is commented out.  WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED WRITING A FUNCTION, COMMENT OUT 
% THE SOLUTION, UNCOMMENT THE CALL TO YOUR CODE, AND USE THIS SCRIPT TO 
% TO TEST YOUR FUNCTION.  Check that this script runs to completion and 
% that your answer matches the solution.  Once your function seems to be
% working, submit it for the unit test.
