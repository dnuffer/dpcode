function factorList = constructGeneticNetwork(pedigree, alleleFreqs, alphaList)
% This function constructs a Bayesian network for genetic inheritance.  It
% assumes that there are only 2 phenotypes.  It also assumes that either 
% both parents are specified or neither parent is specified.
%
% In Matlab, each variable will have a number.  We need a consistent way of
% numbering variables when instantiating CPDs so that we know what
% variables are involved in each CPD.  For example, if IraGenotype is in
% multiple CPDs and IraGenotype is number variable 1 in a CPD, then
% IraGenotype should be numbered as variable 1 in all CPDs and no other
% variables should be numbered 1; thus, every time variable 1 appears in
% our network, we will know that it refers to Ira's genotype.
%
% Here is how the variables should be numbered, for a pedigree with n
% people:
%
% 1.  The first n variables should be the genotype variables and should
% be numbered according to the index of the corresponding person in
% pedigree.names; the ith person with name pedigree.names{i} has genotype
% variable number i.
%
% 2.  The next n variables should be the phenotype variables and should be
% numbered according to the index of the corresponding person in
% pedigree.names; the ith person with name pedigree.names{i} has phenotype
% variable number n+i.
%
% Here is an example of how the variable numbering should work: if
% pedigree.names = {'Ira', 'James', 'Robin'} and pedigree.parents = [0, 0;
% 1, 3; 0, 0], then the variable numbering is as follows:
%
% Variable 1: IraGenotype
% Variable 2: JamesGenotype
% Variable 3: RobinGenotype
% Variable 4: IraPhenotype
% Variable 5: JamesPhenotype
% Variable 6: RobinPhenotype
%
% Input:
%   pedigree: Data structure that includes names, genders, and parent-child
%   relationships
%   alleleFreqs: Frequencies of alleles in the population
%   alphaList: m x 1 vector of alpha values for genotypes, where m is the
%   number of genotypes -- the alpha value for a genotype is the 
%   probability that a person with that genotype will have the
%   physical trait
%
% Output:
%   factorList: Struct array of factors for the genetic network (In each
%   factor, .var, .card, and .val are all row 1-D vectors.)

numPeople = length(pedigree.names);

% Initialize factors
% The number of factors is twice the number of people because there is a 
% factor for each person's genotype and a separate factor for each person's 
% phenotype.  Note that the order of the factors in the list does not
% matter.
factorList(2*numPeople) = struct('var', [], 'card', [], 'val', []);

numAlleles = length(alleleFreqs); % Number of alleles
