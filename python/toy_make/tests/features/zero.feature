Feature: Compute factorial
    In order to play with Lettuce
    As beginners
    We'll implement factorial

    Scenario: Factorial of 0
        Given I have the number 0
        When I compute its factorial
        Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 1
    Given I have the number 1
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 1

  Scenario: Factorial of 2
    Given I have the number 2
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 2

  Scenario: Factorial of 3
    Given I have the number 3
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 6

  Scenario: Factorial of 4
    Given I have the number 4
    When I compute its factorial
    Then I see the number 24
