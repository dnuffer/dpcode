You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node
contains a single digit. The digits are stored in forward order, such that
1's digit is at the tail of the list. Write a function that adds the two
numbers and returns the sum as a linked list in forward order
e.g. 1->2 + 3->4 = 4->6
